This is my project for a security system utilizing wifi signal strength to detect intruders.

It runs has a server backend that processes data that comes in from wifi card sensors positioned around a router.
When something moves inbetween the wifi card and the router the signal strength changes and can be deteced.
The server logs that event and sends an alert event. 

In the future This service would send a notification via text message, app, or email.
